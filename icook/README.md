11/20 notes:

Design changes and rationale located on iCook website.

Use cases 1 and 2 are functional and completed. 

This indicates that the scanner and pantry features are operational. Additionally, the recipe database has been created but
needs more elegant data handling. Further releases will implement the comparison functions between the pantry and recipes.
